## Creating a subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper (30 minutes)

Using what we've learned as guidance, create your own subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper that does the following:

* Creates a database, called "store"
* Creates a table called "televisions", with the columns:
	* id
	* brand
	* size (i.e. 40")
	* price (integer)
* In the main activity of your app, insert at least 5 televisions into the database

In a commented line above each SQL method of the SQLiteOpenHelper, write the equivalent raw SQL String you could use as an alternative.

Be sure to leverage documentation!
