## Git

- `git clone ` + repository SSH link
- `cd` into your new repository on your laptop
- Do some work; make some changes
- `git add .` will stage all of your changes
- `git commit -m 'will commit your staged files to git'`
- `git pull origin master` will bring down any changed files to your computer
- `git push origin master` pushes your _committed_ code to Github
