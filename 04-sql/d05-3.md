## 3. Coding our Search

- `@Override` the `onNewIntent(Intent intent)` method.
  * This method handles Intents that do not require our activity to be restarted; instead this event fires when we go back to an Active Activity.
- Define a custom method to handle various Intents sent to our activity.
  - In lesson, I called mine `handleIntent(Intent intent)`
- In your `onCreate` and `onNewIntent` methods, call your custom method that handles intents (again, mine was called `handleIntent()`) and passes our `getIntent()` or `Intent` objects.

```java
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // prior code
    handleIntent(getIntent());
}

@Override
protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    handleIntent(intent);
}

private void handleIntent(Intent intent) {

}
```

- Finally, inside of `handleIntent`, check to see what type of Intent you have.
  * We can check for search by...
  * `Intent.ACTION_SEARCH.equals(intent.getAction()))`
- **IF** this is a Search action, we want to get our user's _query_
  * `intent.getStringExtra(SearchManager.QUERY)`
- We can then send this data off to a Cursor, to a Toast, to whatever... we just have to tie it all together
