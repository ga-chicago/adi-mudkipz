## Test Cases

A **Test Case** is a set of conditions that confirms if a feature is working as expected. If all of the conditions are true, then the feature is functional.

For instance, if you added the ability to login to your app, it would be something like the following:

**Login Test Case**
*The feature is implemented if the following conditions are true:*

1. The user can login successfully
2. An error message is shown when the user inputs incorrect credentials
3. The user can retrieve their password if they forgot it
4. The user is able to sign in as a guest

All of these mention the user and focus on what the user can do with that feature. In the end, the users should be the main concern for all of your apps.




#### Let's make test cases

Test cases are usually associated with computer programs, and in general, they should be associated with features.

To prove that point, let's build a house! This house has three features: a bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen.

1. First, let's open a Google Sheet or an Excel tab write/type the names of the test cases in columns

	* Bedroom Test Case, Bathroom Test Case, Kitchen Test Case

2. Let's discuss: What requirements are needed for each room. Put them in the appropriate columns?

	* e.g., the bedroom needs to be big enough to fit a bed, the bathroom needs a toilet and bathtub, etc.

3. Now, take one minute to reword the requirements as user stories, so they relate to the "user"

	* e.g., the person needs to be able to take a shower, the person should be able to cook food, the person can fit a bed in the bedroom

When you're finished make sure you have this doc handy. These test cases will be used for the next guided practice.
